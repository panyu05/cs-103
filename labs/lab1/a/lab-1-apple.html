<h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
<p>My name is Yu Pan. I am a first year at Boston University majoring in Graphic Design at CFA and planning to pursue a dual degree in Advertising at COM. I have lived in Coventry, Rhode Island my whole life prior to coming to BU. Being from a small town, I knew that I wanted to study in a city where there was more to do so when I was researching colleges, Boston University stood out as the top candidate. It was not too far from home but provided much more opportunities. Having been in Boston for the past semester, I have really enjoyed going out to explore the city, visiting new cafes and restaurants, meeting new people, and becoming more independent. But when I am not in school, I am usually working at my parentâ€™s restaurant. Also, this is my first time taking a computer science course so I am a little nervous but much more excited to learn more.</p>
